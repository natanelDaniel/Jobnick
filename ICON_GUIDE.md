## Online Resizers

## Testing Your Icons

After creating the icons:
1. Place them in the `icons/` folder
2. Load the extension in Chrome
3. Check if the icons appear correctly
4. Verify they look good at all sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Icons Not Showing
- Make sure files are named exactly: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
- Verify files are in the `icons/` folder
- Check that files are actual PNG images, not renamed text files
- Ensure file sizes are reasonable (should be a few KB each)

### Poor Quality at Small Sizes
- Start with the 128x128 version
- Use simple, bold designs
- Avoid thin lines or small details
- Test how it looks at 16x16 before finalizing

**Remember**: The icons represent your extension, so make them professional and recognizable. Simple is often better than complex!
